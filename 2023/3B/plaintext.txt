Dearest Miss Styles,
I must admit that I was unconvinced by your claim that we would find anything of note in the volume that you sent me. You are right that it has some value as a special edition of Poe's work, but I could not see anything remarkable about it that might explain the presence or the death of the young man you found in the library. It is a fine specimen, and it was with some reluctance that I attacked the binding as I did not expect to find anything remarkable therein. You can imagine my surprise then to discover the attached note, clearly written in a cipher, and carefully concealed between the leather and the end boards. Even then I assumed this to be a publisher's trick to promote the edition given the prominence of encryption in the tale, but consulting with my friends in the book trade, none of them had heard of such a conceit, and I could not find any record of an advertising campaign referring to such a curiosity.
At this point I felt I should at least attempt to decipher the message and quickly discovered that the author had used the very mild convention of a shift cipher, clearly intended to be broken. The first line read "Recent events have made it clearer than ever to me that I am in mortal danger", and the rest contained much to alarm me, especially the rather clumsy reverse acrostic which read MURDER (though for the longest time I assumed it to read RED RUM which caused me much confusion).
Whether or not this concealed message points to the unfortunate death of your interloper is not apparent to me, but I think you are right that its presence should be sufficient to encourage the police to reopen the case. I will forward a copy of this letter, together with my findings, to my friend Tom Harper. As Chief of Police, he should have the power and influence to do so.
With my best wishes,
Maurice
Dr. Maurice White M.D.
