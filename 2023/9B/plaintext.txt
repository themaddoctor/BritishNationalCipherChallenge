Dear Mr Rogers,
You will never know how relieved I am to hear that the Library will remain intact and here at the Manor. I know that you were keen to support our City in its ambition to rival New York, with its Astor and Lennox libraries, but together we have spent considerable effort building a unique collection of rare and important works, and I would have been deeply saddened to lose it.
I was touched by your offer to make it a condition of the donation that I should continue to be employed as the curator, but the Manor is my home as well as my workplace, and it feels right that this important collection of rare books should remain here in private hands where I can care for it properly.
I am sorry to hear that you will be withdrawing from the race for Governor as I know that was a cherished ambition. I am sure you would have filled the role with distinction, but there will be other ways to serve and I think you are right that the strange death of Stanley Isles would have undermined your campaign. We know what gossip can do in the small world of Rhode Island society and your opponents would have taken great pleasure in speculating on the unexplained death in your home.
As you requested, I have completed my audit of the library contents, and I can assure you that nothing is missing and no books have been harmed. I will of course continue to protect them and I hope you will agree that it is worth continuing to invest in the collection. Together we can build it into one of the finest archives of American literature on the East Coast.
I understand that your niece, Nancy, will be visiting next week, and I look forward to seeing her again. While she does not share our love of fine books, she certainly loves this house and I am sure she will have her own ideas about how to freshen it up.
I remain a loyal servant to you and to the Library,
Maisie.
