The fourth hint for Challenge 10A



Challenge 9A was a very simple cipher in which the letters in positions 1,3,5, 7, 9 etc were left along and the letters in positions 2,4,6,8,10 ... were shifted by the letters to their left. Many of you noted that this is a special case of a Hill cipher, Why not look that up?
