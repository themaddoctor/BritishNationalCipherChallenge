Harry, thanks for all your help. I have really enjoyed this case and I hope you have too, but we might have finally reached its natural end. The team in the document section took a look at Maisie's encrypted diary and found the following note sewn into the binding. I should have noticed before - the diary has the same stitching style as the edition of The Gold Bug found next to Stanley's body, which seems more than a coincidence!
The text is encrypted, but not in any way we have seen before in this case. It should be the perfect test for our trainees. I won't say any more right now, but we ran some tests on the ciphertext and, as we discussed, I will release a few prompts to help them on the BOSS forum. I think you have already suggested a schedule so I will try to stick to that, but if we get any suitably cryptic hints from the faster trainees as they crack it, I might publish some of those too.
Have you got a theory about what was going on? I had a suspicion last week, but I hadn't nailed all the details and there were still a few surprises in the plaintext. I wonder how many of the recruits had already worked it out. Maybe they will get in touch to tell us.
I will publish the cipher and key before we wrap up so everyone should be able to see how it works. Even if they can't break it on their own, they should have enough to go on by the end of the exercise and, of course, I will publish the decrypt as usual.
In the meantime, have a great holiday. They know how to do it properly in the US though I hope you like cinnamon! Rhode Island gets a lot of snow, so here's hoping for a White Christmas.
Looking forward to seeing you at Bletchley in the spring.
Jodie.
