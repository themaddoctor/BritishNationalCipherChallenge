Please confirm date your agent Isles arriving New York. Will arrange accommodation as required. List required books missing. Please send again so can ensure they are on display.
Will leave instructions for entry at hotel desk. Isles to ensure no-one observes entry to Manor estate. Date of departure also needed.
Will send details for payment by a separate telegram so please do not reply to this one.
Must emphasise need for complete care and discretion. Collection very valuable. Many rare items. Source easily identified if disposed of together. Can help with storage and shipping after collection if necessary but will need advanced warning.
Do not contact Ms Styles with queries.
