Welcome to the BOSS training division, my name is Jodie, and I will be supervising your development here in the agency. It is great to have so many new recruits and I hope that you will enjoy the exercise.
I have had several roles in the organisation since I joined, with extended periods working in the field, but for now I head the Archaeologists Division, our name for the BOSS cold case section. Here we mine sources of historic intelligence that might be useful in live cases. We also research novel cryptographic techniques and use the case files we hold as exercises for staff training.
I am borrowing the material we will use from Scotland Yard. I came across it a few years back in the Shadow Archive, during The Kompromat Files investigation. It wasn't relevant at the time, but it caught my eye: a request from the Pinkerton Agency in the US for information about a young man whose body had been found in the library of a country house in New England. It sounded like a classic of the genre, but I was too busy to read it then. I think it might be fun, so from next week we will have access to the original documents and we will try to solve the mystery together.
If we need anything that is not contained in the files then I have an agent on the ground in the US who should be able to help. Harry suggested that as part of your training I should give you access to the encrypted communications from that agent, Harry himself, so you will be able to practice breaking them too. It will be fun to see what he comes up with to test you!
Good luck, Jodie.
