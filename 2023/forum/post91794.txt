Here is a new one, a true story that happened hundreds of years ago.
The secret to saving oneself from poison was to drink a stronger poison.
There was an excellent physician who served in egypt's elite circles, who was asked to compete against a rival. They each had to create a poison and drink first the opponent's, then their own. Our physician created a 'poison' made of diluted wine. He drank the other's, then his own and survived. The opponent did the same and died. How come?
