Harry, thanks for the files you sent me, we have a much better picture of what happened, but I am still not very clear why, and I am not entirely sure I know who in the household was involved.

Maisie was clearly very anxious about the Library. The attached extract from her spells out her deep attachment to it. Moreover the effort and money she spent trying to establish evidence connecting the household to the attempted theft shows how important it was to her. Is it possible that it wasn't Rogers who organised the theft? Could someone in the Manor have had a grudge against Maisie? Stealing from the Library seems like a good, if convoluted, way to get at her.

I would like to read more of Maisie's thoughts, but she was very careful. Her diary pages were encrypted with a host of different ciphers, and as time went on she adapted and strengthened them. This one looks hard, but it is really pretty easy. The later ones get a lot tougher!

Anyway, we need to plan our next steps. Could you try to get a list of the members of Rogers' household and make enquiries about them? It would be good to know if there was anyone who had a reason to dislike Maisie. We should not discount Maisie's theory that the theft was part of an insurance scam either, but I find it hard to believe that Rogers would have risked his reputation and his chance of the Governorship even if he was short of money. People like him could usually find someone to back them.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Jodie
