Dear Harry, I can't thank you enough for all your support over the last few years and while I will miss the freelance life, it is good to be back in the office working with the team.
I know it surprised you when I asked to return to the Archaeologists, but I liked the interaction with the trainees and there is some really interesting stuff lurking in the archive. Anyway, after the last couple of years I need some time away from the day-to-day pressures of live action.
If my move back to the historic files surprised you, my promotion to Head of the division was a complete shock to me. I spent an evening wandering round the archive in awe. I hadn't been given full access before and had no idea just how comprehensive the collection was. It was a little overwhelming at first, but I think I am getting the hang of it. Choosing the right file as a training exercise is an interesting challenge, but I hope I will learn from the trainees as well as from you.
I am glad you took my advice and are taking a break. I hope you like the Mansion, I never visited, but I have seen photos and read a lot about it. The library is particularly interesting ... I am looking forward to hearing back from you. Did you get the Agatha Christie I sent?
How are you keeping busy? I am guessing sudoku and crosswords, though the bookshelves may be calling too strongly. Which reminds me, M from the puzzle group sends his best wishes. He hopes to see you when you get back, maybe at our Bletchley meeting.
I had better get on with work, but perhaps you can help me with something? I found a slip of paper tucked in one of the files and while I can easily decrypt it, I think there is something else hidden in it. Maybe I will get the trainees to take a look at it and see if they can find anything.
All the best,
Jodie
