Tom my dear friend,
I was somewhat surprised and confused to receive your letter asking me about the note that Dr White discovered in the binding of the book found by Isles's body. I cannot see how you could think I would know anything about it, and I find it extremely unlikely that it could have been written by anyone in my household. Your claim that the characteristics of the type can be used to identify the source as the typewriter we hold in the Mansion seems to me to be divination, not science, and without much stronger evidence of a link between someone in my household and the young man Isles, I will not entertain or cooperate with any further investigations.
I have already expressed my consternation at the prospect of a scandal derailing my campaign for State Governor, and I thought that you understood and agreed with me. Why you would want to re-open the case, when I have so much to lose and we have nothing to gain from it, I cannot understand.
I know that Maisie has been pressing for further investigation, and it is clear that she was deeply distressed by the whole incident. She loves the library and would do anything to protect it, however she is merely a servant of the Estate, and surely my status as present owner gives greater weight to my views and wishes. While Isles clearly trespassed, he seems not to have caused any damage, and even if he was intending to steal from me, his untimely death forestalled that plan. He has already paid the price for his misdeeds, and I do not see any reason to continue to poke and probe at what must surely be a routine case.
I must insist that you bring a final halt to your investigations and let him rest in peace. Let us not invite gossip at this critical time.
Yours in friendship,
Rogers.
