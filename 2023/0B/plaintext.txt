Recent events have made it clearer than ever to me that I am in mortal danger.
Except the Hall is haunted or I am going mad then I must be the victim of a cruel hoax; I fear for my sanity and my life.
During the night I hear sounds of people whispering, but when I search, I find no-one.
Rogers tells me that I am imagining it all and that I need to calm down, but I cannot.
Unless my persecutor can be found and stopped I will either go mad or be killed.
Maisie is the only one I can trust, but do I dare share my fears with her: would she believe me, and would doing so put her in as much danger as I appear to be in?
