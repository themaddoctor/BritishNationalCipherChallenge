Dear Friends,

It is with dismay that I must inform you of the most dreadful news. It appears that our letters are now being intercepted by Prussian agents. The enclosures were passed to me by a dear friend. As you can see our message has been succesfully deciphered and translated from our mothertongue to German. I have no news of how the decipherment was accomplished. However it may have been a mistake to retain so much order in our Playfair grid. I will write again later in the week with any news from my friend of how the cipher was broken so easily.
