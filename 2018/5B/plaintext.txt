the april uprising in bulgaria and its brutal suppression by the turks
has caused outrage in the chancelleries of europe there is a risk that
russia will take this as the excuse it seeks to engage the ottomans and
if they act and take constantinople then our trading routes to india
will be under threat at home gladstone's pamphlet bulgarian horrors and
the question of the east has stirred a public appetite for action which
could lead to support for intervention and make things difficult for the
prime minister he is faced with mortons fork if he supports action then
it will be difficult to condemn russian interference if he counsels
inaction then he risk appearing weak and callous at home and abroad it
may appear unfortunate that our political leaders are unable to agree on
policy strategy or tactics and it is true that this could lead to
confusion about our aims but on reflection i think that the public
disagreement between gladstone and disraeli presents an opportunity
their dispute conducted in parliament and the press demonstrates to the
world the two faces of the empire at the same time morally engaged and
yet prudent this may allow us to proceed with discretion to try to
influence the actors and to direct the play away from the glare of the
footlights it may be possible to engage the league of the three emperors
to our cause bismarck is particularly keen to maintain a balance of power
in the region and to avoid further war and he will not need to be
convinced that an unbridled russia is not to his advantage so i think
we can rely on him to rein in russia's expansionary vision on the other
hand the league itself may present a longer term threat to the empire
given the breadth of its influence in northern europe and we must tread
carefullythe emperors envoys will be meeting in reichstadt soon to
determine the response to the crisis and i need a plan to influence
the outcome as always our strategy must be to sow confusion and on
this i plan to ask for advice from baron playfair he has recently
concluded his commission of enquiry into the civil service and if
anyone knows how to control an agenda it must be our own civil servants
