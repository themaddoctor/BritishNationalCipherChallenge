her majesty is right, life in boston is dull, but not dull enough to persuade me that working for her would be worth the risk. but of course she had an answer for that. she pointed out that returning to the united states carried its own risks.
i had kept myself amused for the last few years separating the greedy and venal from their money by a variety of means, not all of them entirely approved by the law. i was left wondering how the queen knew about that, and whether my cousin had been instructed to tell the federal marshalls about my activities. discretion seemed the wise course, and anyway, how often do you get a job offer from a queen?
charles has done a sterling job developing a network of agents and his intelligence operations have become a key part of british diplomacy. the growing instability across europe threatens the empire, and it is her majesty’s belief that we will need to respond in kind to destabilise our enemies before they grow too strong. this is a new and dangerous kind of warfare, but could, i suppose, save lives, and we will, in any case, need to match our enemies if we are to stay ahead.
this entire operation must be kept secret. first from our enemies, but second, and just as important, from the official machinery of state. her majesty cannot afford the risk that her government could be implicated in these operations, and sir charles has reason to believe that the foreign office may have been compromised. for this reason we need to move sir charles’ intelligence operation to a more secure location. and i think i have an idea where that could be!
