the note you sent over was trickier than i expected. jamelia didn't just
reverse the whole message before encrypting it, she put all the punctuation
and spacing back in the original places to throw the casual reader off the
scent. it wasn't very sophisticated, but it was devious, and tells us
something about the way she thinks. one thing i am certain about, this
doesn't read like a suicide note. who writes one of those in code?

our field agent asked around at the university and was told that jamelia's
boyfriend worked in the same lab as her for a while. his name is martin
traynor and they both did an internship in their second year at a spinout
company called dynamix. that is a small startup which works on the fringes
of the arms industry, but no-one seems to know much about it.

i am not sure why dynamix would have hired jamelia; you said that she was
working on gravity waves, which are a seismological phenomenon. i read an
interesting paper called "gravity waves in earthquakes" which suggested that
they might be responsible for the destruction of high rise blocks during some
tremors. but unless dynamix are planning to try to weaponise earthquakes i am
not sure why this would be of interest to them. we need to know more about her
work and what they hired her to do.

there are a lot of questions even in the first note:

why did martin leave?
where is he?
why couldn't she get hold of him?
what was too big for jamelia to handle alone?
what made jamelia feel guilty?
how was she planning to fix it?

i am hoping that the attached document will answer some of these questions
but it will probably just raise others. i found it pasted under the cover
of the notebook that the previous message was taken from. i can see why the
police missed it, though it wasn't a very professional job.
