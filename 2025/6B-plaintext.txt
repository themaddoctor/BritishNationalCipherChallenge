My dear R,

You are clearly of the view that I and my colleagues are undervaluing what it is that you are offering, and I am writing to assure you that that is far from the case. Even if it were, you will know that other less scrupulous businessmen are willing to exploiting any and all inventions with no payment for the originator and we remain your surest guarantee of due recompense. Renegotiating our deal will only slow our progress and if others get wind of this opportunity, you risk losing everything you have negotiated with us.

It is of the highest importance that we conclude this stage of our collaboration as quickly as possible. You have told us that D is planning to meet with the President soon, and once he has assurance that the government supports his plan things will move very quickly. I cannot promise to hold my investors together if they think their interests are better served elsewhere, so winning their firm commitment now is in all our interests. It is crucial that you and I convince them of the value of this property, and you are best placed to acquire the evidence for us. I urge you to beg, borrow or steal a conclusive demonstration of the value of the product, or to provide a fuller description of the plot, in order that I can finally persuade my friends to commit to backing us.

Yours anxiously,

Molinaro
