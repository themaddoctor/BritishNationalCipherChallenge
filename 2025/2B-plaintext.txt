For the attention of General Dodge

Mr Dodge, while I cannot claim to have recovered fully from the rigours of my journey, I have now adjusted to your climate and have begun to establish my routine. I hope you will not take it badly that I am reluctant to agree to your request to expedite my visit to Washington, but I am no longer a young man, and my performances require considerable energy from me. Age is the thief of time, and none of us know how quickly it is stolen from us. I must do what I can to martial that most precious resource.

Our mutual friend, Mr Babbage, has commended you to me, and our own prime minister has taken pains to explain to me the importance of your mission, however I fail to see how rearranging my schedule will do anything much to speed the progress of what must necessarily be a long-term investment of capital and resources. I have promised that I will do what I can to assist you, but I must consider my own health and welfare if I am to complete this tour.

May I also remark that if the work on which you are embarked is truly as secret as you and Babbage seem to believe, then the use of ancient ciphers does not meet that need. I have taken the liberty of using something a little more appropriate in this letter and would suggest that perhaps we use this method for our future communications.

Yours sincerely,

Charles Dickens
