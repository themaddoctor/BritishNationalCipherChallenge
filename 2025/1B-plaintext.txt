My dear Mr Dickens,

I trust that your journey was uneventful and hope you will not mind my directness in writing to you on your arrival in New York. I appreciate that you may need a little time to set your own plans in motion, but things are moving somewhat faster than I envisaged when I first approached Mr Babbage with my proposal. I fear that in these dangerous times it is necessary to react to events with speed if we are to have any hope of shaping our destiny. With luck it is not too late to embark on our venture.

I understand that your schedule is not yet finalised, so can I implore you to consider moving forward your visit to Washington? There are people here of consequence who are eager to meet with you, and who might be persuaded by you to join with us. If the sacrifice of so many good men and women is not to be wasted, then we will need their support. You have already shown a remarkable skill in exposing injustice and persuading the wealthy to work with you to address it on your side of the Atlantic. Here in the United States, we are desperately in need of your advocacy if we are to consolidate the gains won in our most uncivil war.

With my very best wishes,

Grenville M. Dodge
