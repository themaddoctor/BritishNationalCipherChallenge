[Using the Index of Coincidence to Determine Vigenère Keyword Length](https://youtu.be/zmKCaKYkBMU)

Did you break Challenge 6A yet? If you did you will have learned that 6B is probably a Vigenere cipher. Those are hard to break unless you know the length of the keyword.

Here is a great video to help you learn about the process!
