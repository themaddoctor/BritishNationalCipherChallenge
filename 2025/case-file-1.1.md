Grenville M. Dodge was an ex soldier and engineer who made his fortune in the reconstruction after the civil war. From his letter to Dickens it seems that he had a social conscience, but perhaps that is not surprising for someone who dedicated himself to the unionist cause and all it stood for. He seems to have been a friend or acquaintence of Charles Babbage, which perhaps suggests that there might be something more to his letter, but only time will tell!
