DEAREST GRENVILLE,

I AM SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU AGAIN, BUT A WARNING: CHARLES IS ON THE WARPATH. XHE HAS GOT IT INTO HIS WOXODEN HEAD THAT YOUR WORK IS IN SOME WAY LIKELY TO INTERFERE WITH HIS OWN PRIVATE MISSION.

I THINK HIS RAGE IS DIRECTED IN PART AT HIS OWN FEXELINGS OF INADEQUACY. DURING HIS FIRST VISIT XTO YOUR COUNTRY, HE ASXSUMED THAT HIS EVIDENT POPULARITY WOULD LEAD TO PRESSURE FOR XREFORM OF THE US  PUBLISHING INDUSTRY AND IMPROVED PROFITS. UNFORTUNATELY, HE DISCOVERED THAT THIS VERY POPULARITY WAS PREDICATED, IN PART, ON THE WIDE AVAILABILITY OF CHEAP, UNAUTHORISED REPRODUCTIONS OF HIS WORK. HIS VERY PUBLIC CAMPAIGN TO MAKE HIS BOXOKS MORE XEXPENSIVE, TO NO-XONE’S SURPRISE BUT HIS OWN, WEIGHED DOWN HEAVILY UPON HIS REPUTATION AS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE AND HE LEFT YOUR COUNTRY A DEFEATED MAN. HE IS VERY MUCH XHOPING THAT HIS RECENTLY RENEWED POPULARITY, COMBINED WITH A SOMEWHAT MORE DISCREXET  APPEAL TO THE HIGHEST AUTHORITIES, WILL ACHIEVE HIS AIMS WITHOUT DENTING THE CURXRENT ENTHUSIASM OF THE CROWDS.

TO THAT END HE VIEWS HIS FORTHCOMING PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT AS HIS LAST BEST CHANCE OF MEETING HIS AIMS. THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS ARGUMENT WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, WHO, IT MUST BE SAID, HAS SOME SYMPATHY WITH DICKENS’ POSITION. IT IS NOT ONLY THE LITERARY ARTIST WHO SUFXFERS FROM THEFT, BUT ALSO THE XENGINEER, DESIGNER AND ENTREPRENEUR, SO THE PRIME MINISTER IS VERY HAPPY FOR CHARLES TO TRY TO CHANGE THE MOOD IN WASHINGTON ON THIS TOPIC.

SPEAKING OF INDUSTRIAL THEFT, I TURN TO THE MATXTER OF MILLER AND ROKESMITH WHO MAY BE XENDEAVOURING TO STEAL OUR PLANS. I CANXNOT DETERMINE ON THE BASIS OF THE MESSAGES WHICH WE HAVE DECIPHERED WHETHER THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE KU KLUX KLAN TO UNDERMINE OUR PLANS DIRECTLY, OR IF THEIR INTERESTS ARE ENTIRELY COMXMERCIAL. PERHAPS THEY ARE HOPING TO SELL THE DESIGNS, OR TO MANUFACTURE RIVAL MACHINES AND OFFER THEM AT A CUT PRICE TO THE GOVERNMENT. INDEXED, THERE COULD BE A WIDER MARKET OF GOVERNMENTS AND ORGANISATIONS WHO WOULD RELISH A RENEWED ABILITY TO MONITOR THE COMXMUNICATIONS OF THEIR RIVALS, AND IT WOULD CLEARLY NOT BE IN OUR INTERESTS TO ALLOW OUR TECHNOLOGY TO FALXL INTO THEIR HANDS. ESPECIALXLY NOT BEFORE WE HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON THEIR ETHICAL USE.

IF WE MIGHT UNCOVER THE IDENTITY OF ROKESMITH WE MAY BE BETXTER ABLE TO DISCERN WHICH OF THESE POSXSIBILITIES IS MORE LIKELY OR AT LEAST ACT TO DISRUPT HIS OR HER INTENTIONS.

YOURS ETC,

BABBAGE
