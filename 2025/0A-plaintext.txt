The National Archives in Kew contain a thousand years of history. Documents of state dating back over a thousand years are carefully preserved and studied by historians from around the world - files that are often sensitive and marked with a release date which could be as long as one hundred years for particularly sensitive information. Much less well known is the Shadow Archive, deep inside the home of British codebreaking which contains files that might never be released. They carry the mark DTA, which denotes Delegate to Archaeology, the team responsible for them but the archivists joke that it stood for DON'T TELL ANYONE. These files contain secrets that, along with their cipher keys, were lost long ago. No-one knows what treasures they might contain. It is your job to break the ciphers and to find out!
