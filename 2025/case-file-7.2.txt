# Case file 7.2

Computing the frequencies of letters in part B shows that the distribution is really too flat to be a mono alphabetic substitution or transposition cipher, or even a combination of those methods, so it is most likely to be a polyalphabetic cipher like part A. The tricky part is working out the length of the cipher key. If we are lucky that is the only tricky part and this will turn out to be another Vigenère Cipher, with key length of, say, 6?
