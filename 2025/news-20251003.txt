Know any good jokes?

3rd October by Harry

I don’t mean just ANY good jokes, I mean good maths jokes. Or Science, or Philosophy. One of the best things about the cipher challenge is the community, and the T.E.M.P.E.S.T. forum is where it gets to hang out. So if you do know any good jokes that you think the rest of the Cipher Challenge gang might like, then do head over there and tell us. Same for good books, films, puzzles, our door is open to them all.

This post was triggered by a philosophy joke I hadn’t heard before, maybe you will like it.

    In xenosociology class we learned about a planet full of people who believe in anti-induction: if the sun has risen every day in the past, then they think it’s very unlikely that it’d rise again.

    As a result, these people are all starving and living in poverty. An Earth xenosociologist visits the planet and studies them assiduously for 6 months. At the end of her stay, she asked to be brought to their greatest scientists and philosophers, and poses the question: “So why are you still using this anti-induction philosophy? You’re living in horrible poverty!” The lead philosopher of science looks at her in pity as if she’s a child, and replies:

    “Well, it never worked before…”
