SORRY JUST NOTICED AN ERROR IN MY POST

I gave:
The host then gives YOU a bucket and instructs the other five to each put 35 coins into
it from their own bucket, to be your share of the reward if YOU win it for everyone.

It should be 34 coins like so:

The host then gives YOU a bucket and instructs the other five to each put 34 coins into
it from their own bucket, to be your share of the reward if YOU win it for everyone.

It does not alter the answer but gives unequal winning amounts to contestants and spoils the story
