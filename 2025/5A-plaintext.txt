My dear Molinaro,

Thank you for your letter and for your encouraging response. I fear it may be a little while before I can provide further material for you and your collaborators to peruse, but I think that the reputation of their progenitor and the obvious attraction of such a novel innovation might be enough to persuade them of the value of an investment. Indeed, if they are true in their desire to obtain this material then I think they will recognize that there may be others who are also willing to bid for it too. I am fond of you, and am still ardently hoping that we can come to an arrangement that will suit all parties, including D. I would only beg that your partners do nothing to make it harder for me to complete my part of this bargain.

I remain yours truly,

Rokesmith
