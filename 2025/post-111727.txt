Ho RATS, just what is the next number in the sequence?

1,2,4,8,16,?

If you say 32 then you could be right.

However, if I said the next number is 77 becuase the sequence I have in mind
continues 145 668. . . so we have:

1,2,4,8,16,77,145,668,?

Then what is the next number?

    I will be very interested to see if anyone gets this! Harry
