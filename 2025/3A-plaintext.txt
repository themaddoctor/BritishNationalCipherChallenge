My darling Clara,

I was at first pleased and then alarmed to receive your letter. Happy of course to know that you have arrived safely in New York and then alarmed at your account of the burned note. I was stung by a dark pang of jealousy, fearing that it might be a lettre d'amour. Could it be the reason that he did not allow me to accompany him to New York? I am proud to say that I dismissed this wicked thought as unworthy of us both and was unsurprised though, I must confess, a little relieved to read your explanation of the identity of the sender.

The mystery remains as to what business the General had with my beloved, and why he has chosen to communicate with Charles in code. I suppose it might be connected with Charles's meeting with Mr Babbage and the Prime Minister on the day before he left. The door to the study was closed, but voices were clearly raised during the discussion and Charles was in a terrible mood afterwards. He would only say that he was "too old to be involved in skulduggery!"

If not, then I suppose that the letter might have concerned the activities of the Ghost Club. Is that too fanciful? While the society is hardly secret, some practical men are dismissive of an interest in spiritualism, and I can imagine that a man who has made his reputation as an engineer may feel that such an association would damage his standing.

Is there any way that you could ascertain the contents of this correspondence, or the nature of the relationship between them? I am most curious to learn.

Yours affectionately,

Ellen
