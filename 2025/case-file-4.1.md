Are you still stuck on Challenge 4 part A? The blocking of the text into fives is an established trick to disguise the structure of a text and it can be remarkably effective in obfuscating (great word!) the plain text. Here a simple frequency count tells us a lot though. Notice the spikes at O and D in the cipher text (gold bars). They are clearly higher than the other peaks in the gold distribution. They are matched by peaks at E and T in the standard English distribution (white bars). What do you notice about the distances between the gold peaks and the white peaks? Does that suggest anything about the cipher that might have been used?
