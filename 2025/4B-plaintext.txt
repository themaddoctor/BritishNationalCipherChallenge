General Dodge,

I have followed your work with great interest and have been most impressed with your energetic development and promotion of the north American telegraphic system. I have spent many years studying mathematics and engineering, discussing the challenges involved in electrical transmission and storage of information with my friend and colleague Charles Wheatstone. I was delighted when you approached me with your proposal and have spent many hours discussing it with my closest confidantes.

Beyond our common interests as men of science, your letter convinced me that we also share a concern for humanity and liberty, and I think I can see how our complementary skills could profitably combine to the benefit of free men everywhere.

I am reluctant to commit my comments on your idea to paper, even secured with this cipher, partly because my own research has shown just how illusive that security can be. Given those concerns I would prefer to discuss matters in person, but I am too old for the rigours of an ocean crossing. Fortunately, my dear friend Mr Charles Dickens is planning to visit your country shortly, and I am hoping that I will be able to persuade him to act as an intermediary. He is reluctant to get involved in affairs of state, but the Prime Minister, Lord Derby has indicated his support for your suggestion, and perhaps his gift for persuasion will encourage Mr Dickens to engage with us.

I hope you will not mind me emphasising the need for complete confidentiality concerning this letter. If you have decided on reflection not to take this matter further, then please destroy this paper and we will speak no more on this subject. If, however, you are interested in developing your idea further with us then I would suggest applying one of the more secure modern ciphers to your reply. I will furnish you with suitably disguised keys by telegram.

With my very best wishes,

Charles Babbage
