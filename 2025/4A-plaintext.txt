My dear Lord Derby,

I must admit to some confusion after reading your letter, as I cannot clearly see how I might be of any assistance to you. Perhaps that shows a want of imagination on my part, but I truly fail to see how anything I could do would have the least influence upon the great affairs now stirring across the ocean.
You are quite right that we share a deep dislike of that dreadful institution, slavery, and I rejoiced — as you did — at the victories of Mr. Lincoln and the new hope they bring to so many long-suffering people. Yet I cannot believe that anything I might write or say could move the Congress or the President towards a just course, if your own efforts have not already persuaded them.
Nonetheless, Mr. Babbage is most insistent that I should hear your scheme, and I will be in London next week for a meeting of the Ghost Club. If you are willing, we might meet there, or, if you prefer a quieter setting, at the Atheneum.

I remain, my dear Lord Derby,

Very truly yours,

Charles Dickens
