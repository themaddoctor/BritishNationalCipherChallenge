My Dear Rokesmith,

How gratifying to hear from you. I was concerned that the thirteen days of silence since your last message might have indicated that you had changed your mind about our arrangement.

The document you provided is extremely promising and my partners are keen to see more. Are you likely to be able to obtain more samples? If I am to convince others to invest then it would be good to provide them with evidence of the value of their purchase. Some have hinted that there are other ways that they could proceed, but I think it might be possible, and certainly would be better for you, if we could negotiate something favorable to all parties.

Of course, D may be plotting another course and may take some persuasion to commit to our proposal, but you have assured us that you have some influence on his decisions, and I am relying on you to help "seal the deal".

Your faithful friend,

Molinaro
