Each week Jodie and I will post two new documents for you to decipher. They are taken from the archives here at BOSS central and relate to events occurring over one hundred and fifty years ago. I have a feeling that they might still be relevant!!!

Your task is to decrypt each of the documents and upload your solutions on the Challenge pages. If you make a mistake you will get some feedback and can try again. You will get a score for each attempt and we will build a leaderboard using those scores. If you are in a team, then only the team captain can upload submissions, so make sure you work with them to get your answers submitted.

In your account pages you will find a record of your submissions, together with a copy of a certificate recording your progress. If you want you can allow your teacher to follow your progress by getting the team captain to enter a special PIN number (the teacher's  Monitoring PIN) into the team details on their account page.

If you have any questions then head over to the forum where you will find lots of friendly advice!

Good luck,

Harry
