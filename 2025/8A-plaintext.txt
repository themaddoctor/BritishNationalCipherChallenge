General Dodge

I understand from our mutual friend Babbage that you wish to brief me for my forthcoming visit with the President of the United States. I hope that you will not think me too direct when I tell you that I feel this to be rather an imposition. I have agreed to convey your concerns for the rights of the newly freed men of the South, and you will know from my writings and my activities that I am in full agreement with your plans. I cannot readily understand what our meeting can add to that, but Charles insists that we should meet, and as an old friend I feel I must oblige.

You will know that my first concern in meeting with the government is to secure agreement on protection for the work of artists, composers and musicians. For too long now, American publishers have made free with the work of others to which they have no right and should have no rights. It is in the power of your Congress to protect those whose labours are too easily stolen, and I feel it is my duty to persuade them to use the powers they wield to provide that protection.

During my first visit to your country, I learned that my position did not fall well with the people, and I left thoroughly disillusioned with little hope that things might change. But change is stirring and the rights of the less powerful are in the ascendent. I will consider myself to have failed if I do not achieve a reform of copyright enforcement in the United States. This may not have the moral force of emancipation, but it is still a matter of liberty, and I must stand by my principles. If you wish me also to petition the President on behalf of your scheme, then I will do so, but on the understanding that it is a secondary concern and I will do nothing to undermine my own mission.

Babbage asked me to convey the following information to you. He would not explain the meaning, saying only that you would understand:
