This is an old math puzzle given in my own made up narrative.

A column of (Type E)Bots is moving slowly forward at
exactly one mile per hour. Bot End-E who is at the
rear of the column gives a message to a courier Bot, Speed-E,
who has just arrived by his side, the message is to be
given to Bot Head-E who is at the front of the column
ten miles ahead. Speed-E sets his controls to be back
at End-Eâ€™s side in exactly one hour and a constant
speed in MPH to achieve this.
When Speed-E is at the side of bot Head-E the message is
instantly transferred as Speed-E instantly reverses and
travels back to End-E on time.

What was the constant MPH speed that Speed-E set?

Anyone with an answer should save it and post it on Tuesday 30th September
this means all answers will be seen together when the Keymaster puts them ALL up at
the same time (to be determined by the Keymaster!)
