My dear Countess, Mr Babbage,
I have completed my investigations at the Imperial Arms customs warehouse and will return forthwith, but knowing just how long that journey may take and how remarkably swift your Royal Mail can be, I thought it best to send you my report by letter.
My new friends in Liverpool were real helpful and provided me with the shipping papers, although I am not sure how much assistance they will provide. All I can see is that the crates all left the United States together and each weighed the same, suggesting that nothing had been taken. I find it mighty unlikely that anyone interested in stealing the contents of a single crate would take the trouble to replace them with a carefully calibrated weight of rubble or other nonsense, and in any case the seal had been replaced. That seems like an awful lot of trouble for a few rifles and boxes of ammunition.
With the crates in storage the seals have been removed, presumably to allow your customs officials to inspect them, and that gave me an opportunity to examine the contents. It took me a long time to work through them all, but its the darnedest thing. There is nothing missing!
And I mean, nothing! Not even a single bullet! And we know that at least one was left on the floor of the warehouse in Erin.
My friends tell me that a Hindu gentleman had been seen in the vicinity of the shed in the past night, but I am minded to think that is just scuttlebutt. Folks in Erin talk like that about strangers all the time and with nothing to connect him to the cargo and no way to track him down I think we can ignore, if not forget, the gossip.
I hope to be with you again in three days and look forward to discussing this mystery with you then.
Miss Kate Warne
