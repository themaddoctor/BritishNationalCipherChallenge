My app can encode and decode the type of cipher that you gave but NOT SOLVE it.
It is of course very difficult to resolve due to not having the word spacings
and or the length of the key, I feel sure it can be done with a lot of trial and error.

Anyway I am giving the same challenge back to you, same rules. Will you solve it?
