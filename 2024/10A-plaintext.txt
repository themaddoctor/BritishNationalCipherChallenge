JANUS PROJECT FILES PART THREE The detonators enclosed in the shipment are of our own design and each can produce a shockwave equivalent to that of a small rifle cartridge. Accordingly, they take up a similar space, though the absence of any projectile means that more can fit into the crate. The deployment of those devices should be relatively routine. Being small and unobtrusive they are extremely unlikely to be discovered under casual inspection, especially since we have been able to colour their cases using the exact paint specified for the India Pavilion steelwork. This is due of course to the influence of our patron, Herr Kaiser, to whom we owe our deepest thanks.
The charges are too small to cause much damage to the steelwork itself, but since it is not our intention to destroy the pavilion, but only to clear it, this is not a significant issue. A suitably coordinated discharge should achieve our aims, and the ingenious new timing mechanisms, employing the marvellous miniaturised clock mechanisms developed by the company, will ensure maximum impact.
