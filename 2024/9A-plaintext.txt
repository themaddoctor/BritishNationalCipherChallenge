The worst outcome for the maintenance of peace in the Indian subcontinent, would, without doubt, arise from a three-way conflict between the Hindu, Sikh and British parties. Tension between them is already high, with the Maharaja resenting deeply the theft of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. The humiliation entailed in being forced to part with it has left a deep scar, and any further provocation could well lead to open conflict.

The proposal to recut the gem is just such an insult. If, in this tense atmosphere, anything were to happen to the diamond then war might well ensue. Indeed, were the Hindu community to be implicated in any way, then this conflict would be likely to spread. The only winners in such a situation would be those in a place to profit from the violence.

Short of direct intervention it seems highly unlikely that such a precious gem could be allowed to suffer any harm. However, given the nature of the display of the gem at the Exhibition it would be very hard for anyone to be sure of its safety. And if, say, there was any evidence of a plot by the Rajahs to steal the diamond then the other two parties would be likely to react forcefully.

Babbage and Palmerston seem remarkably sanguine about the security of the diamond, but I suspect that this is merely a display of the famously phlegmatic British spirit. They undoubtedly have in place a number of measures intended to protect it, but even they cannot have foreseen every eventuality.If the diamond were to be left alone for any length of time then it would be highly vulnerable to theft. It is safe, I think, to assume that the guards are under strict instructions not to leave it alone, but it is not difficult to imagine situations in which they would be forced to do so.  Nor ways which an agile mind could find to engineer such a situation.
