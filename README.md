# British National Cipher Challenge

This is an unofficial archive of the British National Cipher Challenge
(https://www.cipherchallenge.org/). The purpose is to collect all parts
of the challenges in one place and to preserve them before they are lost
to bit rot and server decay. The official site only goes back two years, and
archive.org and other sites are also incomplete.

Stuff in this archive is copyright University of Southampton. If they ask
me to, I will have to remove them.

The 2018 challenge is now in session. Answers to it will only be posted
here after they have appeared on the official site.

All ciphertexts and plaintexts are present. Not all ciphers have been identified
(see below).

Some data are missing that are necessary for anyone who wants to attempt the
challenges. We know that, and we're sorry. Here is a list of the missing bits.
If you have any of them, please upload in the "issues" section.

- 2005 part 8B: the original wiring diagrams or photos needed to reconstruct the machine
                (FialkaSettings.pdf)
- 2006 part 7B: the PDF reconciling the literal decryption with the original plaintext
                (Solution7text.pdf)
- 2010 part 8B: photo of the "first half" of the deck of cards (we have the final photo
                that reveals the solution)
- 2015 part 8B: the original photo of the deck (we have one after two more cards were added)

These ciphers and/or keys have not been completed. If you know the solutions, please make
a comment in the "issues" section.

- 2004 part 8B (solitaire cipher; the key we have does not work)
- 2005 part 8B (at the moment, solution is only present as an Excel worksheet)
- 2012 part 8B
- 2013 part 6B (a transposition cipher of some sort)
- 2017 part 8B

For those who care about such things, these posters are missing:

- 2002 poster
- 2016 full-sized poster
