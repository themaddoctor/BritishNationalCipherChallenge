In his journal dated the Ides of October in the year of the consulships
of Caecelius Tullius Capito Pomponianus Plotius Firmus and Gaius Cornelius
Gallicanus, Agricola wrote "The mystery of the battle at Camulodonum is at
last solved. Calgacus may be a barbarian now, but he was a Roman citizen
then, who betrayed us all for love of a barbarian. it has taken all my
skills as a leader of men to keep him alive. The legionnaires spend their
evenings designing new and cruel ways to execute him in revenge for the
shame he brought upon us, but his life is precious. It is the only card
left to play in our search for salvation and the return of the stolen
aquilae. If we can also recover the codex then perhaps its loss can be
concealed and our lives will be spared." Releasing the Roman traitor
Calgacus must have stuck in the proud Agricola's throat, but he made a
pact with the remaining Caledonii and travelled north to exchange the
prisoner for the aquilae and the codex. But the cunning Caledonian
tribesman set another trap and presented Agricola with a forgery cunningly
assembled with pages from the books stolen when the tribe ransacked Mons
Graupius. For too long the sons of Rome had underestimated the people in
Britannia and while the aquila of the legion had been restored by the
exchange, their honour was not. Agricola faced a return to Rome,
humiliation and almost certain death. The sixth chapter of my tale of
woe is guarded by lightning, bull and oak.
