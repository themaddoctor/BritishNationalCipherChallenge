L, I think we made a mistake in hiring Jade. I carried out checks on her friend Harry, and he doesn't exist. I can't find any record of where he is from either here or in the UK, and no-one seems to have seen him arrive in Culpeper. I spoke to the cleaner who services his suite, and she told me that Jade had bribed her to give him access to the rooms several days before she asked us to pay for them, and the hotel records agree. She is definitely covering something up.
I also spotted something in the vault records that I had missed before. Tallmadge used the British date convention when he signed in on the eleventh of June. It is a strange thing for an American to do and I wonder if he is connected with Jade in some way. What if she is a double agent working for Tallmadge's team? Where did you get her name?
Maybe it is paranoia, but I have the strong feeling that I am being followed, and I am pretty sure that I spotted Tallmadge's car parked near my home next to a utility van that has been there for a few days. I didn't remember the plate, but the make, model and color were all the same. If the gang are onto us, then we could be in real trouble.
We may have gotten in over our heads. I need somewhere quiet to stay for a few days. Do you still have a membership at the club? Could I use that? I will tell people I am taking a few days off and lie low while I make some more enquiries.
In the meantime, could you keep tabs on Jodie? Tell her I will be back in a few days and try to make sure she stays focussed on the vault cipher. If I am wrong about her then she could still be useful. If I am right, then it will be good to keep her distracted.
