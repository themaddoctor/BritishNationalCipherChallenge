I could get used to the high class hotel life, but I could never get used to paying for it, so I thought it was a little too good to be true when I found the suite opposite to Jodie unoccupied and unlocked. I didn't expect to be able to stay here undetected for very long and was planning my next move when the bell hop arrived with a hot meal and a note.
Hotels don't usually feed you before throwing you out, so this was probably just a mistaken room number, but I didn't want to draw more attention to myself than I had to, so I paid a tip (fifteen percent - any more or less would be memorable) and sat down to enjoy it.
I didn't notice that the note really was addressed to me until I had finished. Just one word on the envelope: BOSS.
At first glance I assumed I had been tracked down by my superiors and that this was my recall, but just as hotels don't feed deadbeats, spy chiefs don't pay for room service in places like this, so that had to be wrong. I should have recognised the handwriting.
The note was from Jodie, and as we had guessed, she knew I was here. It didn't say much apart from that, but I guess she might say more at dinner.
