Dear Ms Frank,
It was great meeting you and I am pleased to accept the contract to investigate the strange circumstances at Culpeper County Bank.
As discussed, I will need full access to the bank transaction records, the current and recent staff files, and any surveillance footage that you can provide, either from the bank, the streets outside or from neighbourhood stores.
I examined the box that you found on the floor of the vault and need to correct you on one thing. It was not empty. The inside of the lid had a sheet of vellum paper lightly fixed to it and when I removed that I found nine Chinese characters inscribed in a square pattern on the reverse. I traced them onto the attached cover sheet and would be grateful if you could ask the bank officials whether they recognise them. It is possible that the paper was glued in when the box was made, it was certainly intended to look like that, but given the absence of any other clues at this point I think it is worth checking if this could have any significance.
You can contact me at the RC; I will be moving there this afternoon and they are expecting a call from you to arrange the expenses facility that you offered.
I look forward to your reply.
Jade Cifrar
