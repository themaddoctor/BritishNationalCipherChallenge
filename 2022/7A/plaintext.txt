While Jodie followed Tallmadge, I headed to a downtown coffee shop and started to do my homework. Benjamin Tallmadge was, to say the least, an unusual name, and an internet search linked it to a spy from the war of independence. The original was leader of the Culper ring, which didn't seem like a coincidence, and another jug of coffee gave me time to explore the link.
The original Culper Ring was set up by Washington and Tallmadge to spy on the British. Washington had suggested the name and taken it from Culpeper County, Virginia. Most of their activities were focussed around New York City, with the agents and spies recruited from Long Island and Connecticut. They worked for about five years reporting on the British troop movements using codes and spycraft to stay undetected.
As far as I could see there was no record of the ring operating in or around Culpeper, which made sense - no one ever chooses a code name connected with the operation, but that left me wondering why our new Mr Tallmadge was operating here and what they were up to. On a whim I searched "Anna Smith, Tallmadge" and the result was a surprise, but Smith is a common name, and I wasn't sure it meant anything.
The bank vault was clearly important, but since the boxes didn't contain anything other than numbers it must be the case that the numbers themselves have a meaning. I was on to my third jug of coffee before I found the Culper Code Book online, and things started to make sense. I dug out the list of boxes and numbers that Jodie had given me and started to put it together, but unfortunately, just as I began, my phone rang and when I picked it up I had received an audio message from Jodie. It was in morse code and encrypted. If she was taking that much care then I knew we must be in big trouble ...
