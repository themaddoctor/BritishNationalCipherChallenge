Jodie is making this very easy for me. Her recent case notes were left on an encrypted USB key attached to her key chain. I had taken the suite opposite and reversed the spy hole in my door so I could watch her movements. I thought I had been careful, but I swear that she glanced over at me as she locked the door to her room, then she walked away down the corridor leaving the keys in the lock. I wondered if I should call out to her, but perhaps she was checking that I was not there before leaving the keys, rather than trying to make sure I was. Until I can be certain that she is reaching out I will have to be discreet.
The encryption on the USB is easy to break, using a simple keyword substitution. It contains just one file, with notes on her investigation, and she has channelled her inner Sherlock, eliminating the impossible to arrive at the only logical conclusion. In short, someone has a secret, and someone else, the Chief Teller, wants to know what it is. They think Jodie can assist, and maybe Jodie is trying to tell me about it. I don't know if that is because she thinks she needs my help (I am pretty sure she doesn't) or if she thinks I need to know about it. But until we can find a way to re-establish trust, it is going to be difficult to find out which.
