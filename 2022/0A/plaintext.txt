Dear B
You can add this to your pile of "just in case" letters. If you get to read it then I suspect it will raise more questions than it answers and hopefully I will be around to answer them.
If everything goes according to plan you won't even open this, and that would be better for us all, especially for Jodie.
I am writing this so it can be used as evidence in the hope it won't come to that. At the end of the Lighthouse Conspiracy investigation I told you that Jodie had requested extended leave after a hard case, but that was not true. She disappeared leaving me a note suggesting that she had joined the conspiracy. I have left my notes from the end of the investigation in the case files in case they help.
When I realised that she wasn't coming back I tracked her to Delhi where I found a trove of papers explaining more about the group, and that relieved some of my anxiety, but not all. A rogue agent is never a good thing whatever their motivation.
I asked a few friends to keep an eye out for Jodie and at last I think I may have picked up her trail. A colleague in the US intercepted the attached letter which I am pretty sure was addressed to her. Ms Cifrar is just the sort of alibi she would use and this is the sort of case I can imagine her working on.
I will head over to the US to see if I can track her down. If I am successful and can persuade her to return, then you won't get to read this journal. If I fail then I guess we have some difficult conversations ahead.
Very best wishes,
Harry
