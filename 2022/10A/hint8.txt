An eighth and final hint for Challenge 10A

The last word of the message is attached, enciphered as
 a 	T
 t 	a
 c 	J
 e 	H

When the second letter of a pair follows a it seems to be enciphered as itself, but when it follows c it has been shifted by 2 and when it follows e it has been shifted by 4. Can you spot the pattern now? We will leave it to you to finish.

Have fun and Happy Holidays,

Harry and Jodie
