Harry,
The lamplighters gave me a box to track Tallmadge's phone signal and I followed him northeast out of Culpeper on the highway. I closed him down just as he was joining the I Sixty-Six and immediately wished I hadn't. We were heading for Washington, and I began to get a bad feeling about it. That crystallised into a deep uneasiness as he turned off onto the Georgetown Pike and I realised where he was heading. We have a problem, I just don't know what sort or how big, but we need to find out quickly.
I backed off and cut the trace in case it triggered an automatic alert - he has access to a lot more technology than we do, and I can't be sure that the phone trace is undetectable. I am sure that his employers will not be happy to find me on his tail, and I certainly don't want to spend time in a basement trying to explain myself to them.
I called off the lamplighters before they could realise who he was working for. It was one thing asking them for a favour, when I thought this was a routine commercial contract, but it is another entirely to drag them into the hole that I seem to have dug for myself. I also have Anna to think of. I was confident I could follow Tallmadge without discovery and had hoped he would lead me to her, but I didn't know then who I would be up against. With the resources he will have available it will be hard to avoid detection by staying away, let alone by following him to the office. I plan to hole up in Arlington. It should be busy enough to give me cover. Can you join me here? We need to make a new plan.
Jodie
