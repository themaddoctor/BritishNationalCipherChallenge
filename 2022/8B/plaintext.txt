I took a quick detour via the Bank before heading out to meet Jodie, as there was something I wanted to check. With no official access to the vault, I had to wait until after dark to make my own way in.
Thankfully I had learned something about banks while working in Berlin after the war, and this building was of the same vintage. The security cameras and movement detectors were bang up to date, but that meant that they were software based and easy to bypass with a little BOSS know-how. The vault itself would have been another matter: the huge and heavy door, hardened steel on bronze phosphor hinges. I couldn't have cut through it if I had wanted to, and I really didn't want to. I needed my visit to be a secret. But what I did learn back then was that banks are staffed by humans. They get tired, lazy and curious, and as we know, it is hard to train someone out of that. I had a feeling that vault box twenty-three would still be in Anna's office. She had gone to a lot of effort to make an excuse to remove it, and I didn't think she would be in a hurry to put it back.
I was right. It was sat square in the middle of her desk with the lid open and the paper lining, carrying its nine Chinese characters, loosely fitted back in the lid. I helped myself to what I needed, returned everything to the way I found it and left, hoping that no-one would know that I had ever been there.
Getting into the bank had taken me longer than I expected, and I still had to drop off my elicit gains at the lab before I could meet up with Jodie, but she is a tough cookie, and I didn't think she would worry too much about me being late. That seemed a lot less risky than sending a message. It was just possible that Tallmadge had spotted the tail and was conducting his own surveillance; I was not going to make it easier for him than I had to.
