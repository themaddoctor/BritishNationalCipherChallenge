I managed to trace Jade/Jodie to a suite at a high-class hotel downtown. The sort of place only a bank could afford, and I couldn't stay there myself, even if I was on expenses. I think it would have been tempting fate anyway. If I can find Jodie, I am sure she can find me. Something in her letter tells me she already has.
In any case, I decided to keep a long tail on her, if only to avoid spooking anyone else who might be following her. I am focusing on intercepting her comms with Lynn Frank. They are still using fairly light encryption, and it is easier to get access to Ms Frank's office than it would be to infiltrate Jodie's room at the hotel. Those places take the security of their clients even more seriously than the banks.
The attached letter shows that Jodie is getting more cautious, but it also seems to be an invitation to get involved. I am not sure where to go from here. As Jodie says in the letter, the numbers in the sign-in book suggest something odd, but unlike Jodie I won't have access to the vault to check it. Is she hinting that we should team up, or warning me that she knows I am here and should keep away? (If you are not sure what I am talking about, take a very careful look at your decrypt of her letter. You should find a hidden message.)
By the way, there is something nagging at me that I can't quite place. There is a name in the sign-in book that, in my head at least, is connected in some way to the name of the bank, and I can't remember what that connection is. Maybe it is not important, but I won't sleep properly until I can figure it out.
Once you have cracked Jodie's letter, head over to the case files and take a look at the signatures. Maybe you can figure it out for me.
