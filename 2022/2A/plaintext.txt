I WAS HOPING I WOULD FIND YOU HERE. WITHOUT THE OFFICIAL SUPPORT OF BOSS, IT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO TRACK JODIE DOWN AND I AM GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP.
I STOLE THE ATTACHED NOTE (NOT SURE THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO PUT THAT GIVEN THAT THIS OPERATION IS STRICTLY OFF THE BOOKS) FROM LYNN FRANK'S OFFICE, AND I THINK IT IS FROM JODIE. THE WORD NEIGHBOURHOOD SUGGESTS IT WAS WRITTEN BY A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER RATHER THAN AN AMERICAN, AND IT IS SIGNED OFF CIFRAR AGAIN. I CALLED THAT AN ALIBI BEFORE, BUT MAYBE NOM DE GUERRE IS MORE APPROPRIATE.
I NEED TIME TO DECIPHER THE REPLY, BUT EVEN THE PAPER IT IS WRITTEN ON IS A CLUE. IT IS THE SORT YOU FIND IN THE FANCY HOTELS, SO I WILL START LOOKING THERE. THEY ARE NOT REALLY JODIE'S STYLE, BUT IF SHE IS FREELANCING FOR BANKS, SHE WILL WANT TO GIVE THE RIGHT IMPRESSION. WHICH GIVES ME AN IDEA. I THINK I WILL TAKE A MUCH CLOSER LOOK AT THAT LETTER.
